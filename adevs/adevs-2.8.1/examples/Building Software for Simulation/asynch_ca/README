This is the asynchronous cellular automata from section 4.5 of "Building Software
for Simulation". The Makefile assumes that you are using the GNU C++ file. To
build the simulator execute 'make'. This will create the executable 'a.out' that
is the simulator. Running this example creates a file 'image.bmp' that contains
the discrete trajectory of the cellspace, as shown for example in Figure 4.13 
of the book. 

You will need to install the SDL library before trying to build and run this
example. After installing the SDL, check that the Makefile points to the proper
installation directory. If you are using a popular Linux distribution, then
the SDL may already be installed. Otherwise, You can get the SDL library at
www.libsdl.org; this example requires version 1.2.x (where x is the latest
release in the 1.2 series).

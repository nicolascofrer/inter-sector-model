This directory contains the model of the press and drill that is
described in section 4.2.3 of "Building Software for Simulation".
Only the bottom up example is contained here. The makefile assumes
that you are using the GNU C++ compiler, but should be easily
to build in any development environment. The input files
'input', 'input_a', and 'input_b' contain the trajectories used to
construct table 4.2 and described in section 4.2.4.

This directory contains examples of models that may be compiled
into modules for adevs by the Open Modelica compiler. Each model
produces a model described by ordinary differential equations.
The compiler is not yet setup to handle DAE's, but should soon
be extended (at least) to semi-explicit DAEs. The compiler
is also restricted to handling events expressed as if-then statements.
Other types of events must be handled by deriving a class from
the model generated by Open Modelica. The robot and tank examples
show how this is done. The Makefile contains examples of how
to compile and link the Modelica models.

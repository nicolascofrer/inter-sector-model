This is the circuit example from section 5.4 of
"Building Software for Simulation. The Makefile
provided with this example assumes that you are
using the GNU C++ compiler. To compile the simulator
execute 'make'. This will create the executable
'a.out', which is the simulator. See the comments
in circuit.cpp for more information.

# A script to compare two files by matching line to line.
# If both files contain the same lines, in any order, then
# they are considered the same and the script returns 0.
# Otherwise, the script returns -1.
#
# For example, the files
#
# This is line 1
# This is line 2
#
# and
#
# This is line 2
# this is line 1
#
# would be considered identical.
# However, the files
#
# This is line 2
# This is line 2 also
#
# and
#
# This is line 1
# This is line 2
#
# are different.
